Abstract: Not going to the eye doctor often enough can lead to many health problems. The
most common is rapid loss of vision. One of the most common reasons most people don’t get
to eye doctor enough is because of time. Over 75% over the U.S. wears glasses or uses some
sort of vision correction in their lifetime. There are far more patients than providers, leading to
long waits for appointments to correct something as basic as being able to see. With Pocket
Optometrist individual eye exams can be performed at home using a smart phone. The App
prompts the user to hold the front facing camera close to their eyes. The camera will then scan
the user’s eyes, and have the user perform an eye exam at different distances to confirm the
correct prescription needed. The user will answer what they see during the exam using the
devices microphone.

Scenario: Would target elderly who are unable to leave the home due to their health. People
who don’t have severe vision impairments and need a quick and simple eye exam to refresh
their prescription. If someone thinks their vision prescription needs a quick refresher, they can
quickly pull out their phone and perform an eye exam on their own time. Then with their new
prescription they can order their new glasses to improve their vision.
